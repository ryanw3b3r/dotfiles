It contains the installation of some basic 
tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning the repository 
as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running
`macos-defaults` first, then restarting your 
laptop and, after reboot, running `start` script.

```
git clone git@github.com:ryanw3b3r/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
./macos-defaults
./start
```
